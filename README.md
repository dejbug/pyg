Here are some old fiddlings with pygame I wanted to keep online for a few weeks at least, just until I've figured out what kind of project I'd be willing to commit to in the near future. This should be turning into a small but tidy framework.

# examples

## astar

![astar](wiki/examples/astar.gif?raw=true)

Fiddling around with the A* path finding algo.

## autocell

![autocell](wiki/examples/autocell.gif?raw=true)

A quick Conway's Game of Life simulator, just for fun (or maybe later more).

## sm ("space miner")

![sm](wiki/examples/sm.gif?raw=true)

Playing around with hex fields. Don't know if this is the best way to implement the math.

## textbox

![textbox](wiki/examples/textbox.png?raw=true)

Simple text layout (for an in-game edit box perhaps).
